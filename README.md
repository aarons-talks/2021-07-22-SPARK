# SPARK, July 22, 2021

This repository contains slides and code for my talk at SPARK on July 22, 2021.

## Slides

The [`slides/`](./slides) directory has the slides for the talk. They are in [reveal JS](https://revealjs.com/) format. In order to run them, you need a static web server. Support is provided out of the box for [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/). To use it, make sure you have Caddy v2 and run the following from the root of this repository (not the slides directory):

```shell
caddy run
```

After you run this, the slides will be available in your browser at:

http://localhost:9090
