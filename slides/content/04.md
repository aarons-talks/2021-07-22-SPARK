## Channels + Goroutines


```go
// just a plain function. you call it, it blocks, and then returns
func returnSomething() string {
    return "Hello SPARK!"
}

// create a channel. 
somethingChan := make(chan string)

// run the blocking function in a goroutine, thus making it non-blocking
go func() {
    somethingChan <- returnSomething()
}()

// receive on the channel and print out the result.
// the receive blocks until the other function sends it.
// we have effectively run the other function in the background, 
// but made it blocking still
fmt.Println(<-somethingChan)
```
