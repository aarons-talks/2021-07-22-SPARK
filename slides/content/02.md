## Foundation: Goroutines

```go
// just a plain function. executes and returns serially
func printSomething() {
    fmt.Println("Hello SPARK!")
}

// run the function in a background _goroutine_
go printSomething()

// printSomething is running in the background, so your current goroutine
// might exit before it's done
```
